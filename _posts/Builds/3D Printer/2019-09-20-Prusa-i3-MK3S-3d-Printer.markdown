I just got my _Prusa i3 MK3S_ in the main and you can check out a time-lapse of the build process below. The printer came extremely quickly seeing as it shipped from the Czech Republic. The instructions were all very straight forward and manageable. If you can setup IKEA furniture, you shouldn't have any troubles here. All in all, the build took me around 13-14 hours. You can order the pre-build set for only $200 more, so this would be a good option if you value your time and aren't worried about how the printer comes together. They make sure to calibrate and test the machine prior to shipping it out when you buy it pre-built as well. For me, I wanted to understand how all of the pieces came together because 1) I was just genuinely curious about the mechanics and 2) so I would be well equipped to fix any equipment failures over the course of it's build life. If you're looking for a relatively affordable 3D printer, I've been very happy with the quality and price of this one.

Here is the build! Dramatic Hans Zimmer felt like the only appropriate music choice to go with.
